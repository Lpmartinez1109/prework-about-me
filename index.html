      <p>I want to become a web developer because I want to work in a field where I can work towards a career path and I believe that becoming a web developer is a step in the right direction. It wasn't the first thing that came to mind when people would ask me what kind of job did I want or where did I see myself five years down the road. Becoming a web developer means that I've started to focus in on finding the right career for me and I am more than prepare to work hard for it.</p>
